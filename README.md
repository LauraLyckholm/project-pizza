# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

- promt() to then save the value (saveed function in a variable by adding const and a variable name before the promt-funciton, then tested it by using console.log)
- wanted a new line in the alert window, googled for answer \n 
- how to store a value from multiple choices in a prompt, google - switch? The problem was that I didn't know how to write the choices in the prompt-function. I decided to instead make it an if-else statement, and then rain into the problem that my three === compared wrong, because it expected a number, so I had to change it to "3", as a string. Added a variable in each turn of the if-statement stat saved to value.
